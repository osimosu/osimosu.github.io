* I have a B.Sc. in Network Security and an M.Sc. in Big Data.

* My strength is versatility, that is, ability to dive into areas outside my specialization. I've done Networking, DevOps, Backend, Frontend and many more things.

* I'm passionate about security and currently building [Authorize](https://authorize.id/){:target="_blank"}. An MFA solution based
  on [OAuth 2.0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749){:target="_blank"}
