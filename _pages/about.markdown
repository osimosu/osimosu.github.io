* I have a Bachelor's degree in Network Security and a Master's degree in Big Data.

* My strength (and weakness) is versatility, that is, ability to (happily) dabble into unknown waters. I've done
  Networking, DevOps, Backend, Frontend and many more things.

* I'm obsessed with constantly learning and would rather learn a new tool
  on [O'reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/){:target="_blank"} than watch Netflix.

* In the last few years, I've been doing more DevOps work and enjoy it because it enables me to embrace both my
  Development and Operations background.

* I'm very product-driven and love how an idea is translated into a user experience and then a software design and
  finally code that is running in production.

* My passion for Security was recently rekindled, and I've been implementing parts of
  the [OAuth 2.0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749){:target="_blank"}, [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html){:target="_blank"} and the [FAPI-CIBA](https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-ciba-wd-02.html){:target="_blank"} profile into a solution
  called [Yes Identity](https://yesidentity.com/){:target="_blank"}.
