# Hello and welcome!

Here you'll find a collection of articles that I've written about Software development and anything else that I may be interested in at the time. Most of the articles will be focused on something that I struggled with and wanted to share with the rest of you so that you wouldn't have to go through the same challenges. However, it could also just be about something that I thought was very interesting at the time. You can peruse through [all of my articles](_pages/articles.html) or you can also [get to know me some more](_pages/about.markdown).

You can also find me on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4069782/emmanuel-osimosu), [GitHub](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simpledeveloper) and [LinkedIn](https://github.com/osimosu).
