# Hello and welcome!

Here you'll find a collection of articles that I've written about Software development and anything else that I may 
be interested in at the time.

You can peruse through [all of my articles](_pages/articles.html) or you can also [get to know me some more](_pages/about.markdown).

You can also find me on [GitHub](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simpledeveloper), [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4069782/emmanuel-osimosu) and [LinkedIn](https://github.com/osimosu).
