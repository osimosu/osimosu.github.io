# Emmanuel's Blog

This repo is primarily responsible for hosting my blog as a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site at the [osimosu.com](osimosu.com) domain.

# Libraries and Acknowledgements

+ [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/): Used to host the blog.
+ [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/): Awesome library which is used to actually create the content.
+ [Alex Carpenter's Material Design Theme](https://github.com/alexcarpenter/material-jekyll-theme): A Jekyll-based theme built around Material Design. Adds a really nice touch for a blog which is centered around Android development.

# Contributions

Anyone can feel free to fork or clone this repo. I'm not sure why a pull request would occur since this is my own personal blog. However, if someone does choose to do so, please make the request and I'll review what your contributions are.
